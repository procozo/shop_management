            <p>This document addresses the use of intensive programs for pediatric feeding disorders. The term "feeding
                disorder" refers to a condition in which an individual is unable or refuses to eat, or has difficulty
                eating,
                resulting in failure to grow normally. Feeding disorders should not be confused with eating disorders,
                such as
                anorexia, which are more common in adolescence and adulthood. Some common types of feeding disorders in
                children
                include, but are not limited to, adipsia (the absence of thirst or the desire to drink); dysphagia
                (difficulty
                in swallowing); food refusal; inability to self-feed; taking too long to eat; choking, gagging, or
                vomiting when
                eating; inappropriate mealtime behavior; and picky eating according to food type and texture.</p>

            <p>*This evaluation should include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A thorough medical evaluation including neurologic, metabolic and gastrointestinal (specifically
                    malabsorption and gastroesophageal reflux disease) clinical nutritional work-up as indicated;
                    <strong>and</strong>

            <p><sup>†</sup>Possible situations that could initiate an evaluation for a pediatric feeding disorder
                include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Child coughs, chokes or gags while eating or immediately after eating; <strong>or</strong></li>
                <li>Child demonstrates a history of chronic pulmonary difficulties which may include diagnosis of
                    aspiration
                    pneumonia; <strong>or</strong></li>
                <li>Vocal cord dysfunction; <strong>or</strong></li>
                <li>Food is being suctioned out of the child’s airway; <strong>or</strong></li>
                <li>Weight gain is poor and difficult and this is thought to be secondary to an oral-sensorimotor,
                    pharyngeal,
                    or swallowing dysfunction; <strong>or</strong></li>
                <li>Difficulty initiating a swallow; <strong>or</strong></li>
                <li>Structural abnormalities are present that may interfere with the development of a normal swallow;
                    <strong>or</strong>
                </li>
                <li>Chronic food refusal; <strong>or</strong></li>
                <li>“Pocketing” of food during meals; <strong>or</strong></li>
                <li>Excessive length of time getting child to eat (meals lasting greater than 30 minutes);
                    <strong>or</strong>
                </li>
                <li>Neuromotor involvement affecting oral-sensorimotor coordination and respiration; <strong>or</strong>
                </li>
                <li>Chronic poor growth or compromised nutritional status; <strong>or</strong></li>
                <li>Difficulties transitioning from tube or gastrostomy tube feedings to oral feedings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A <em>reevaluation</em> is considered <strong>medically necessary</strong> when there are any of the
                following:
            </p>
            <ol start="1" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>New clinical findings; <strong>or</strong></li>
                <li>A rapid change in individual’s status; <strong>or</strong></li>
                <li>Failure to respond to therapy interventions (for example, speech and language, occupational therapy,
                    physical, and behavioral therapy).</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> There are several routine reassessments that are not considered reevaluations.
                These
                include ongoing reassessments that are part of each skilled treatment session, progress reports, and
                discharge

            <p>The <em>treatment</em> of a pediatric feeding disorder is considered <strong>medically necessary</strong>
                when
                such a disorder has been diagnosed after appropriate evaluation and <strong>all</strong> of the
                following
                criteria are met:</p>
            <ol start="1" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>A thorough medical evaluation, as described above, has been completed; <strong>and</strong></li>
                <li>Adequate treatment for any contributing underlying medical conditions, if present, has occurred
                    without
                    resolution of the feeding problem; <strong>and</strong></li>
                <li>A treatment plan, individualized to each child, is developed and includes diagnosis, problem list,
                    proposed
                    treatment plan with <strong>specific</strong> interventions, and estimated length of treatment.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Other issues that may be addressed include specific dietary interventions or
                special
                formulas, positioning during feeding, behavioral interventions and family or caregiver education.
                Intensity of
                treatment may vary from short-term intermittent outpatient visits to more intensive treatment programs.
                Inpatient or intensive outpatient treatment programs may be warranted for severe cases, such as
                malnutrition or
                failure to thrive, unstable electrolyte disorders, potentially serious allergic reactions to food,
                significant
                difficulty transitioning from tube feedings to oral feedings, etc.</p>
            <p><strong>Not Medically Necessary:&nbsp; </strong></p>
            <p>Evaluation and treatment for pediatric feeding disorders are considered <strong>not medically
                    necessary</strong>
                when the criteria above have not been met.</p>
            <p>A feeding disorder treatment program is considered <strong>not medically necessary</strong> for children
                who can
                eat and swallow with normal functioning, but who are “picky eaters” or have selective eating behaviors
                and yet
                continue to meet normal growth and developmental milestones, and other medically necessary criteria
                above have
                not been met.</p>
            <p>Inpatient admission for a pediatric intensive feeding program is considered <strong>not medically
                    necessary,
                </strong>except when the individual requires facility-based care related to acute medical complications
                of the
                feeding disorder (for example, malnutrition or failure to thrive, unstable electrolyte disorders,
                potentially
                serious allergic reactions to food, significant difficulty transitioning from tube feedings to oral
                feedings,
                etc.).</p>
            <p>Duplicate therapy is considered <strong>not medically necessary.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> When individuals receive concurrent physical, occupational, behavioral, or speech
                therapy,
                the therapists should provide different treatments that reflect each therapy discipline's unique
                perspective on
                the individual's impairments and functional deficits and not duplicate the same treatment. They must
                also have
                separate evaluations, treatment plans, and goals.</p>
            <p>Maintenance programs are considered <strong>not medically necessary.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Note: </strong>A maintenance program consists of treatments or activities that preserve the
                individual's
                present level range, strength, coordination, balance, pain, activity, function, etc. and prevent
                regression of
                the same parameters. Maintenance begins when the therapeutic goals of a treatment plan have been
                achieved, or
                when no additional functional progress is apparent or expected to occur. In certain circumstances, the
                specialized knowledge and judgment of a qualified therapist may be required to establish a maintenance
                program,
                however, the repetitive therapy services to maintain a level would be considered not medically
                necessary.</p>

            <p>Pediatric feeding disorders include a wide range of problems that interfere with normal eating activities
                and
                result in inadequate caloric or nutritional intake, resulting in compromise of the child’s growth and
                development, confirmed when the child fails to consume a sufficient volume or variety of food to
                maintain weight
                or to sustain a normal growth rate (Crosby, 2007; Piazza, 2008). Goday (2019) notes:</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Feeding is a complex process that requires interaction of the central and
                peripheral
                nervous systems, oropharyngeal mechanism, cardiopulmonary system, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract with
                support
                from craniofacial structures and the musculoskeletal system. This coordinated interaction requires
                acquisition
                and mastery of skills appropriate for a child’s physiology and developmental stage.</p>
            <p>Signs and symptoms of a significant feeding disorder may include refusal to eat or drink; difficulty
                swallowing,
                inability to self-feed at an appropriate age, requiring an abnormally long time to eat, choking,
                gagging, or
                vomiting when eating, or other inappropriate mealtime behaviors. If such feeding problems occur for a
                prolonged
                period of time, they will have a significant effect upon the child’s nutritional intake, affecting
                growth rates
                and may result in frequent illnesses, or death in severe cases. Such disorders may also be accompanied
                by
                behavioral problems such as hitting, biting, kicking, tantrums, and vomiting at mealtime as an
                attention-getting
                strategy.</p>
            <p>Feeding disorders are fairly common in infants and toddlers, with approximately 25-35% of these children
                experiencing some difficulties with feeding (Kodak, 2008). The incidence of severe feeding problems has
                been
                reported to be as high as 40-70% in infants born prematurely or in children with chronic medical
                conditions
                (Rogers, 2004). Malnutrition is found in approximately 25-50% of children diagnosed with pediatric
                feeding
                disorder, particularly those children with chronic disease or neurodevelopmental disorder (Goday, 2019).
            </p>
            <p>Feeding disorders may result from a wide range of causes, including medical conditions (for example, food
                allergies, neurologic or neuromuscular disease, gastroesophageal reflux, and others), structural or
                functional
                abnormalities (for example, defects of the palate), or behavioral issues (for example, crying or
                tantrums that
                prevent successful completion of mealtimes). In most cases, there is likely a complex interaction among
                multiple
                causative factors. For example, medical problems such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may
                cause eating
                to be painful. Early experiences with pain during eating can cause the child to stop eating and develop
                behavior
                problems that make it difficult if not impossible for the parent to feed the child. Compounding the
                problem,
                frequent avoidance of eating may contribute to failure to develop appropriate oral sensorimotor skills
                required
                for successful eating and swallowing.</p>
            <p>Infants and children who are tube fed for extended periods of time have an especially high frequency of
                feeding
                problems. In such individuals, it is believed that there are “critical period” for developing proper
                oral
                feeding patterns and reflexes has passed without adequate feeding experiences. This critical period has
                been
                described as being between 6 and 7 months of age, during which acquisition of oral food consumption
                skill is
                most likely. Beyond this period oral feeding abilities may not be established or may be established with
                great
                difficulty (Babbitt, 1994).</p>
            <p>Premature infants and those that are of very low birth weight are at very high risk for feeding disorders
                (Rommel, 2002; Schädler, 2007; Vohr, 2006). The underdeveloped sphincter muscle between the stomach and
                esophagus can cause the infant to spit up frequently during feedings. Because this is uncomfortable for
                the
                child, he or she may not want to eat. One study by Schädler and colleagues (2007) in 86 premature
                children
                describes the successful use of behavioral therapy for severe feeding disorders. However, they indicate
                that
                other conditions such as cerebral palsy, mental retardation and interaction problems, which are frequent
                in this
                population, have a significant negative impact on therapy outcomes and may require an even more
                intensive
                approach to address feeding disorders.</p>
            <p>Disorders of the digestive system can also cause feeding problems. Examples of these types of conditions
                include
                structural or functional abnormalities of the mouth, throat, or esophagus that may result in inability
                to chew
                or swallow, or cause pain during swallowing, or result in aspiration (inhaling food or fluid into the
                lungs).
                Celiac disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, Hirschsprung disease, short bowel syndrome, pyloric stenosis,
                and
                GERD may also contribute to disordered feeding behaviors. A small, controlled study by Mathisen (1999)
                concluded
                that the presence of GERD had a significant negative impact on the energy intake of affected infants.
                Such
                infants demonstrated fewer adaptive skills and readiness behaviors for solid foods, and significantly
                more food
                refusals and food loss at meal times. Christian and colleagues (2021) conducted a single-center
                retrospective
                study of infants with short bowel syndrome and concluded that the majority of infants weaned from
                parenteral
                nutrition and who demonstrated symptoms of a feeding disorder at age 2 continued to have symptoms until
                the age
                of 4.</p>
            <p>Neurologic and neuromuscular disorders, such as cerebral palsy, are associated with significantly
                increased
                difficulty with feeding. In such children, spasticity or weakness of the oral musculature results in
                difficulty
                with oral food preparation prior to swallowing (for example, sipping, sucking, or chewing), but problems
                swallowing may also be present. This may progress from simple frustration to more significant problems
                such as
                aspiration and respiratory infections (Arvedson, 2008; Field, 2003; Gisel, 2008; Rogers, 2004).</p>
            <p>Developmental disorders, such as Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorders, may also contribute to
                feeding
                problems (Manikam, 2000). While such individuals frequently have co-existing physical disorders as
                described
                above, they may also demonstrate unique behavioral issues that impair feeding (Kodak, 2008; Schreck,
                2004). Food
                aversion and food refusal in these individuals are sometimes linked to difficulties with food texture
                and type
                which significantly limit the accepted food options for these individuals. It is important to note that
                feeding
                disorders may be comorbid with developmental disorders without being part of the developmental disorder
                itself.
                There are no developmental disorders whose diagnostic criteria include feeding disorders as defined
                above.</p>
            <p>Evaluation for pediatric feeding disorders is probably best performed by a multidisciplinary team
                (Arvedson,
                2008; Lifschitz, 2001; Rommel, 2003). Members of this team may include, but are not limited to, a
                pediatrician,
                family physician, gastroenterologist, dietitian, occupational therapist, speech-language pathologist,
                pediatric
                behavioral and developmental specialist, psychologist, and social worker. These professionals work
                together to
                assess the individual and determine the possible underlying causes for the disorder, followed by
                creating a
                treatment plan. The assessment process should evaluate a wide range of issues, including the structure
                and
                function of the mouth, upper airway, gastrointestinal tract; as well as behavioral aspects of feeding
                such as
                the parental-child interaction.</p>
            <p>The rationale for treatment is that children whose feeding problems are treated with nasogastric,
                gastrostomy, or
                jejunostomy tubes are more likely to need therapy to become oral feeders. Placement of a feeding tube
                has been
                shown to actually cause or worsen feeding problems for many children (Crosby, 2007).</p>
            <p>Treatment for diagnosed pediatric feeding disorders may also require a multidisciplinary team approach
                (Arvedson,
                2008; Lifschitz, 2001; Rommel, 2003). This team should include the same types of professionals described
                above
                for the evaluation process, to treat both the causative and underlying medical conditions, as well as to
                provide
                the various interventions deemed appropriate for the treatment of the individual. Many studies have
                demonstrated
                the benefits of such a multidisciplinary approach (Benoit, 2000; Byars, 2003; Williams, 2017). Rommel
                and
                colleagues (2003) described the multidisciplinary treatment of 700 infants and young children with
                feeding
                disorders, reporting that almost 50% of the study subjects presented with a combination of medical (for
                example,
                GERD, neurologic or other problem) and oral (for example, oral motor issues, sensory problems, etc.)
                pathology
                underlying their disorder. There were also a substantial number of individuals presenting with combined
                oral-behavioral (for example, food avoidance, tantrums, etc.), and medical-behavioral conditions as
                well. These
                individuals were treated by a team approach, with 73.1% of the individuals experiencing significant
                benefits
                beyond 2 months to 5 years.</p>
            <p>The use of outpatient pediatric intensive feeding programs was investigated in a small, randomized
                controlled
                trial involving 20 subjects ages 13 to 72 months (Sharp, 2016). This study investigated the feasibility
                and
                efficacy of an intensive, manual-based behavioral feeding intervention for children with chronic food
                refusal
                and dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional formula supplementation. Subjects were assigned to
                receive
                treatment for 5 consecutive days in a day treatment program (n = 10) or wait list (n = 10). A
                multidisciplinary
                team implemented treatment and delivered parent training to support generalization of treatment gains.
                The
                primary outcome measures were bite acceptance, disruptions, and amount of food consumed during meals (in
                grams).
                Caregivers reported high satisfaction and acceptability of the intervention. The intervention group had
                9 study
                subjects (90%) and 8 control group subjects who completed the study. The authors reported that the
                intervention
                group demonstrated significantly greater improvements from baseline (p &lt; 0.05) on all primary outcome
                measures, including bites accepted (88.9% for the intervention group vs. 5.6% controls, p=0.008),
                reduction in
                disruptions (55.6% vs. 9.2%, respectively; p=0.038), and volume of food consumed (31 g vs. -1 g,
                respectively;
                p=0.022). No significant change was noted for BMI measurement. A 1-month follow-up suggested stability
                in
                treatment gains.</p>
            <p><em>Inpatient Programs</em></p>
            <p>The effectiveness of inpatient pediatric intensive feeding programs has been evaluated in a limited
                number of
                published studies. One small retrospective case series study involved 30 subjects requiring weaning from
                gastrostomy tube feeding (Brown, 2014). In this study the length of inpatient stay was 19 days and
                subjects were
                followed for an average of 4 months post-hospitalization. The authors reported that the percent of goal
                daily
                calories taken by mouth increased from a mean of 22% to a mean of 92%. A total of 90% of subjects had
                successfully discontinued gastrostomy tube feedings at the time of discharge. No data was provided
                regarding
                gastrostomy tube use during the follow-up period. A second retrospective case series study involving 77
                subjects
                requiring weaning from gastrostomy tube feeding was published by Silverman in 2013. In this study the
                mean
                length of stay was 10.9 days and subjects were followed for 12 months post-discharge. The caloric goal
                obtained
                via oral feeding increased from a mean of 28% at baseline to 83% at discharge. No data regarding caloric
                intake
                was provided for the follow-up period. Gastrostomy tube feeding was ceased in 51% of subjects at
                discharge, with
                another 12% ceasing during the follow-up period. Gastrostomy tubes had been removed from 14 subjects at
                the end
                of the inpatient treatment period.</p>
            <p>The available evidence addressing the safety and efficacy of inpatient pediatric intensive feeding
                programs is
                limited. Further investigation is warranted.</p>

            <p>Federal and State law, as well as contract language, and Coverage Guidelines take precedence over
                Clinical UM
                Guidelines. We reserve the right to review and update Clinical UM Guidelines periodically. Clinical
                guidelines
                approved by the Medical Policy &amp; Technology Assessment Committee are available for general adoption
                by plans
                or lines of business for consistent review of the medical necessity of services related to the clinical
                guideline when the plan performs utilization review for the subject. Due to variances in utilization
                patterns,
                each plan may choose whether to adopt a particular Clinical UM Guideline. To determine if review is
                required for
                this Clinical UM Guideline, please contact the customer service number on the member's card.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, commercial or FEP plans or lines of business which determine there is not a need to adopt
                the
                guideline to review services generally across all providers delivering services to Plan’s or line of
                business’s
                members may instead use the clinical guideline for provider education and/or to review the medical
                necessity of
                services for any provider who has been notified that his/her/its claims will be reviewed for medical
                necessity
                due to billing practices or claims that are not consistent with other providers, in terms of frequency
                or in
                some other manner.</p>
